## P.E.
PE uniforms are required for girls in 3rd grade and up.  They will remain the same as last year's so you do not need to purchase a new one if you already have one. Sr. Hind will be contacting you on how to order the uniform in case you do want to order a new one or if you are new to our school.
East Essence Uniform for grades 5th-12th girls: According to our current HQA uniform policy, girls in 5th grade and up are required to wear abayas to school. Like last year we have made an agreement with East Essence, which is an online clothing store, and will be requiring that all abayas be bought directly from them for the upcoming school year 2016-2017. We have chosen this company due to the quality of their products and inexpensive pricing.
