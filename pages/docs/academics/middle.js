## Middle School Academics
Middle School is a beginning of a new world for your child. This is a time where they will expand core Islamic knowledge,  strengthen academic skills, and mature among caring classmates who support each other through these years of transition.

At Houston Quran Academy, we don't believe that lectures or textbooks alone can inspire creativity and enthusiasm. This is why we base our middle school curriculum on collaborative experiences where students will indulge in hands-on projects. We integrate math and science with wisdom from the Quran. We strive to create students who will become leaders of the righteous.

## Sixth Grade

The 6th grade is a new start for your children's academic life. The curriculum develops an increasing sense of responsibility for organizing your child's school work.  The students are introduced to the concept of long-range projects, requiring them to plan their time and to do more complex tasks in a step-by-step manner.

6th grade is a year of new challenges and growth. Students will continue their studies of literature, grammar, reading and writing in Language Arts, and also cover several levels in mathematics, from general math to Algebra I. Students study medieval and modern European history and have a special Renaissance Festival at Newman’s Castle. They can apply their scientific minds to the study of atoms, elements, bacteria, viruses and animal diversity and can pitch creative scientific ideas in Exploravision.

Electives include Spanish, French, Band, Choir, Orchestra, Speech/Debate, Robotics, Drama, Math Counts, Quiz Bowl, Technology, Geometry Preview, Art, Chess, Videography, Model UN, and many other clever offerings our talented teachers create. Students also compete in formal sports such as football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, cross-country, track, lacrosse and others.

The end of year trip is a fun-filled adventure to Mo Ranch, where students bond through group challenges, outdoor sports, and zany games.

## Seventh Grade
In the seventh grade, the course of study continues to be more challenging. Students are expected to take responsibility for organizing and completing their learning tasks in the various subjects. They are given the opportunity to choose their classes in foreign languages and fine arts. Courses still emphasize basic skill development and reinforcement. This is a time for expanding and exploring their own interests and abilities and for developing an even greater love of learning.

Our 7th grade year at The Village continues to engage and challenge our Middle School students through exciting projects, national competitions, and deep critical thinking.

Students study Shakespeare and create and present books of poetry in Language Arts. History students study Early American History and round off the year with a trip to Boston, where they experience first-hand where the American Revolution began.

Science classes focus on geology and human biology, with projects that include small animal dissections and the National Exploravision Competition. Mathematics courses range from Pre-Algebra to Geometry for the more advanced students, with Math Counts and Math & Science competitions for the very best.

Electives include Spanish, French, Band, Choir, Orchestra, Speech & Debate, Robotics, Drama, Math Counts, Quiz Bowl, Technology, Geometry Preview, Art, Chess, Videography, Model UN, and many others. Students also compete in formal sports teams such as football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, cross-country, track, and lacrosse.



## Eigth Grade

The eighth-grade curriculum is a challenging course of studies designed to prepare the student for college preparatory high school work. Courses in foreign languages, mathematics, and computer programming are offered as high school level courses. Long-range assignments and special projects are important aspects of the program. As is natural for eighth graders, students become more independent and responsible for their own academic performance.
8th grade is an important year of preparation for high school. Students gain more independence and personal responsibility for their work, and teachers put a greater emphasis on research, writing, and higher-level thinking skills.

Language Arts classes delve deeper into writing styles, word meaning, literature, and cross-curricular connections. History classes study Early American History and finish the year with a trip to Washington DC to learn more about our nation’s government and its foundations. Math options include Geometry, Algebra 1, and Algebra 2, and Science integrates physics and chemistry into a fascinating study of the forces that affect our world.

Students can compete in national and international competitions in Model UN, Quiz Bowl, Speech & Debate, and Math & Science, among others. There are also a wide variety of electives are available such as Spanish, French, Band, Choir, Orchestra, Speech/Debate, Robotics, Drama, Math Counts, Quiz Bowl, Technology, Geometry Preview, Art, Chess, and Videography. Students also compete in formal sports teams such as football, volleyball, basketball, soccer, cross-country, track, lacrosse and others.
